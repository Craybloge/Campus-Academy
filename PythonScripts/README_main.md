Considering all the scripts of the exercices are simpler version of the script main.py, so they all work exactly the same way,
so I will only write a README for this one.
## Creation of a/several Christmas Trees
to use the scripts you can either execute them without arguments, they'll use default parameters.
you can also edit them directly, but I recommand you to only change the two constants:
- **number_of_branch:**
    The number of branch (the number of pyramid stacked we could say)
- **number_of_tree:**
    The number of Christmas Tree to print
you can also execute theses scripts with 2 int arguments to change these values.

if you want to edit further (but it may get ugly), you can also edit in the script:
- **incrementation:** In the creation function, it will increase the progressive widening of the branch. By default it start at one and it will be 1 more than the previous branch (you can only change the starting incrementation)
- **width:** In the leaves function, it will increase the base width of the first branch. By default it starts at 1 and increase by 2 for each branch (you can only modify the starting width)
- **height:** In the leaves function, it will increase the amount of leaves for each branch(the amount of stairs for each pyramid if you want). By default it is 4.
